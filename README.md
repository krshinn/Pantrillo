# Getting Started with Create React App

Pantrillo - The Meal Builder and Recipe Finder

This app was constructed as a collaboration between Karl, Isabelle, and Pierce, utilizing React.

We used Spoonacular API for both the drink and meal planning pages.

We created and maintained a MongoDB database for Pantry recipes.  Recipes are limited in order to deploy a minimal production product for presentation purposes with intention to expand.
